# **Text Summarization using Hugging Face Transformers**
This project demonstrates how to implement text summarization using pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library. Text summarization is the process of reducing a text document into a shorter version while retaining its key information.

### **Overview**
In this project, you'll explore how to use Hugging Face's T5 and BART models for abstractive text summarization. These models are pre-trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned or used directly to generate concise summaries of longer texts.
